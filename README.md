# Rust Web Server
Welcome to the Rust Web Server project, a high-performance, safe, and asynchronous web server built entirely in Rust. This project aims to provide a robust platform for web applications, leveraging Rust's unparalleled safety features and its powerful asynchronous runtime.
Author: Drey Smith

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built on top of Hyper, taking full advantage of Rust's async capabilities for non-blocking I/O.
- **Safety**: Rust's ownership model ensures safety and concurrency without the need for a garbage collector.
- **Modularity**: Easy to extend with new features thanks to a clean and modular architecture.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of requests and system behavior for easy debugging and monitoring.
- **Security**: Integrated features for secure communications, including automatic TLS.
